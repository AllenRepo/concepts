            Bridge Pattern aka two layers of abstraction
            definition :    design pattern used in software engineering which is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently". 
                            The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.
